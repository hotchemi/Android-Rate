## How to use

### Implementation

Call `AppRate.monitor(Context)` and `AppRate.showRateDialogIfMeetsConditions(Context)` in your launcher activity.

```java
@Override
protected void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    // Monitor launch times and duration of feeding period from installation
    AppRate.monitor(this);
    // call this method whenever event you want to trigger showing rate dialog
    AppRate.showRateDialogIfMeetsConditions(this);
}
```

### Custom conditions

The default condition to show rate dialog is as below:

* App is launched more than 10 times
* App is launched more than 10 days later than installation.

If you want to use your own condition, please call `AppRate.setLaunchTimes(int)` and `AppRate.setInstallDays(int)`.

```java
@Override
protected void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    // method chain
    AppRate.setInstallDays(0) // default 10
           .setLaunchTimes(3) // default 10
           .monitor(this);
}
```

### Custom rate dialog

If you want to use your own dialog labels, override string xml resources at your application.

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="rate_dialog_title">Rate this app</string>
    <string name="rate_dialog_message">If you enjoy playing this app, would you mind taking a moment to rate it? It won\'t take more than a minute. Thanks for your support!</string>
    <string name="rate_dialog_ok">Rate It Now</string>
    <string name="rate_dialog_cancel">Remind Me Later</string>
    <string name="rate_dialog_no">No, Thanks</string>
</resources>
```
And if you want to decide whether neutral button is appeared, please call `AppRate.setIsShowNeutralButton(boolean)`.

```java
@Override
protected void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    // method chain
    AppRate.setInstallDays(0)
           .setIsShowNeutralButton(false) // default true
           .monitor(this);
}
```
